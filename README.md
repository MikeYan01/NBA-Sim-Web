# NBA Simulator Web

**This is a pure vibe-coding project which migrates original [Java version](https://github.com/MikeYan01/NBA-sim) to the web version. The migration leverages [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), which allows me to focus on product scenarios and predictable outcomes instead of vibe coding every piece from scratch.**

Browser-based NBA basketball simulator migrated from Java to TypeScript/React. Features realistic game simulation with play-by-play commentary, full 82-game seasons, playoffs, and championship predictions.
